# 1. Overview

Bloblang (blobl) is a domain-specific mapping language for transforming structured and unstructured data within stream processing pipelines. It operates on immutable input documents to produce new output documents through declarative assignment statements.

The language emphasizes **explicit context management**: all data contexts must be explicitly named, eliminating implicit context shifting.
