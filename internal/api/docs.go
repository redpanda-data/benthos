.Endpoint caveats
====
Components within a Redpanda Connect config will register their respective endpoints in a non-deterministic order. This means that establishing precedence of endpoints that are registered via multiple ` + "`http_server`" + ` inputs or outputs (either within brokers or from cohabiting streams) is not possible in a predictable way.

This ambiguity makes it difficult to ensure that paths which are both a subset of a path registered by a separate component, and end in a slash (` + "`/`" + `) and will therefore match against all extensions of that path, do not prevent the more specific path from matching against requests.

It is therefore recommended that you ensure paths of separate components do not collide unless they are explicitly non-competing.

For example, if you were to deploy two separate ` + "`http_server`" + ` inputs, one with a path ` + "`/foo/`" + ` and the other with a path ` + "`/foo/bar`" + `, it would not be possible to ensure that the path ` + "`/foo/`" + ` does not swallow requests made to ` + "`/foo/bar`" + `.
